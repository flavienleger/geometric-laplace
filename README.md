# A geometric Laplace expansion

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook written in Cadabra and is companion to the paper

> LÃ©ger, F. and Vialard, F.X. (2022). *A geometric Laplace expansion*.

[Cadabra](https://cadabra.science/index.html) is a symbolic algebra program which specializes in symbolic tensor computations.

## Reading the notebook

The notebook can be [read on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/flavienleger/geometric-laplace/blob/master/cadabra-notebook.ipynb) or alternatively [directly on Github](https://github.com/flavienleger/geometric-laplace/blob/master/cadabra-notebook.ipynb).

## Executing the notebook

If you want to try running the notebook, you first need to install Cadabra. To install locally on your machine please visit https://cadabra.science/download.html. 

Alternatively we provide for convenience a Docker image here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/flavleger/cadabra. This image contains a minimal installation of Cadabra and Jupyter (Lab and Notebook).
